Password Strength Analyzer
=========================

Purpose:
--------
This tool estimates how strong a password is by calculating how long it
would theoretically take to brute-force using modern hardware.

Important:
----------
• No passwords are stored
• No passwords are sent anywhere
• Everything runs locally on your PC

Usage:
------
1. Open the Password Strength Analyzer GUI.
2. Type a password into the input field.
3. Click "Check Strength" to see an estimate of how long it would take
   to crack your password.
4. Use the toggle checkbox to hide or show the password if desired.

Recommendation:
---------------
If you feel uncomfortable typing a real password, use a random or fake one
instead.

Note:
-----
This tool is for education and awareness only; nothing gets saved.
